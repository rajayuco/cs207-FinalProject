    "Being able to calculate derivatives is crucial for optimization, probabilistic inference, simulations and modeling in various fields such as biology, physics, economics, etc. However, functions used for these sorts of purposes in the real world are often very complex, and it can be quite challenging to calculate the derivatives of these functions in practice. Our automatic differentiation (autodiffpy) software computes the derivatives of any function, with respect to any and all of the function's variables, to machine-precision-level accuracy, by breaking the function down into its elementary operations and using the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to calculating derivatives, our autodiffpy software can also perform gradient descent by utilizing a series of backpropagation and forward propagation. Backpropagation is the process of altering a function's parameters until the outputs of the function behave as expected. For example, given a function that has a set of fixed inputs, a set of weights, and a set of desired outputs, our software can be used to tweak the weights until the output of the function matches the desired output. Forward propagation is the process of recalculating the output values based on the change in weights from backpropagation.\n",

    "Our autodiffpy software has many applications, including sensitivity analysis, numerical computation, and machine learning. "

    "Backpropagation is a special case of automatic differentiation and commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function. The motivation for backpropagation is to train a multi-layered computational process such that it can learn the appropriate internal representations to allow it to learn any arbitrary mapping of input to output in order to update parameters and optimize input vectors. The backpropagation algorithm calculates the derivatives starting from the output moving towards the inputs. The calculation of the partial derivatives of the loss with respect to each weight $w_{ij}$ is done using the chain rule: \n",

    "1. When performing gradient descent function, the weights must be stored in autodiff instance where the name must be 'w'. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When multiplying autodiff instance by `numpy array` or `pandas DataFrame`, the autodiff instance must be the first term in the multiplication. Otherwise, numpy or pandas libraries will send individual elements to multiplication, rather than the entire array/dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If an autodiff instance has a matrix value, and is multiplied by a matrix of a different size, the resulting autodiff instance cannot be the denominator of any division. This is because the derivative and value of the resulting autodiff instance will have different matrix shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Gradient descent currently only works with a narrow range of values for data and weight estimates. This is due to a non-optimized adaptive learning rate algorithm."
