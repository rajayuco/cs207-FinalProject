    "Being able to calculate derivatives is crucial for optimization, probabilistic inference, simulations and modeling in various fields such as biology, physics, economics, etc. However, functions used for these sorts of purposes in the real world are often very complex, and it can be quite challenging to calculate the derivatives of these functions in practice. Our automatic differentiation (autodiffpy) software computes the derivatives of any function, with respect to any and all of the function's variables, to machine-precision-level accuracy, by breaking the function down into its elementary operations and using the chain rule (see **Background** for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to calculating derivatives, our autodiffpy software can also perform backpropagation. Backpropagation is the process of altering a function's parameters until the outputs of the function behave as expected. For example, given a function that has a set of fixed inputs, a set of weights, and a set of desired outputs, our software can be used to tweak the weights until the output of the function matches the desired output.\n",

    "Backpropagation is a special case of automatic differentiation and commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function. The motivation for backpropagation is to train a multi-layered computational process such that it can learn the appropriate internal representations to allow it to learn any arbitrary mapping of input to output in order to update parameters and optimize input vectors. The backpropagation algorithm calculate the differentiation from backwards, which is calculating the partial derivative of the error with respect to a weight $w_{ij}$ is done using the chain rule twice: \n",

    "\n",
    "In order to map the difference of input and output of the funciton evaluation, we introduce the loss function is a function that maps values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \"cost\" associated with those values. For backpropagation, the loss function calculates the difference between the network output and its expected output, after a training example has propagated through the network. The mathematical expression of the loss function must fullfill two conditions in order for it to be possibly used in back propagation. The first is that it can be written as an average over error functions for individual training examples. The reason for this assumption is that the backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradient of the error function for a single training example, which needs to be generalized to the overall error function. The second assumption is that it can be written as a function of the outputs from the neural network.\n",
