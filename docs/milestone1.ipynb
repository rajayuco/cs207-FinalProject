    "Being able to calculate derivatives is crucial for optimization, probabilistic inference, modeling in physics, and much more. However, functions in the real-world are often very complex, and it can be very challenging to calculate the derivative of those functions. Our automatic differentiation (AD) software computes the derivative of any function by breaking the function down into elementary functions and using chain rule (see **Background** for more details). The AD software can automatically calculate the derivatives of any arbitrary order, with a high accuracy to machine precision. The software has many applications, such as in sensitivity analysis, numerical methods, and machine learning. "
