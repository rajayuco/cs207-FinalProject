    "Being able to calculate derivatives is crucial for optimization, probabilistic inference, simulations and modeling in various fields such as biology, physics, economics, etc. However, functions used for these sorts of purposes in the real world are often very complex, and it can be quite challenging to calculate the derivatives of these functions in practice. Our automatic differentiation (autodiffpy) software computes the derivatives of any function, with respect to any and all of the function's variables, to machine-precision-level accuracy, by breaking the function down into its elementary operations and using the chain rule (see **Background** for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to calculating derivatives, our autodiffpy software can also perform backpropagation. Backpropagation is the process of altering a function's parameters until the outputs of the function behave as expected. For example, given a function that has a set of fixed inputs, a set of weights, and a set of desired outputs, our software can be used to tweak the weights until the output of the function matches the desired output.\n",

    "Our autodiffpy software has many applications, including sensitivity analysis, numerical computation, and machine learning. "
